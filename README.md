# 🛒 Customer Transaction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a basic SQL implementation to analyze customer transactions for a fictional retail company.  
The goal is to showcase SQL skills for:  
- Data extraction and transformation.  
- Generating insights such as revenue trends, product performance, and customer activity.  

The project includes well-defined database schemas, sample data, and queries to highlight SQL capabilities.

## 🗂️ Project Structure  
The project is organized into the following components:  

### 1. Database Design  
Schema includes three main tables:  
- **`customers`**: Stores customer details (e.g., name, email, join date).  
- **`products`**: Stores product information (e.g., product name, category, price).  
- **`transactions`**: Tracks transactions between customers and products (e.g., transaction date, quantity, total amount).  

### 2. Sample Data  
Sample datasets are provided for each table:  
- `customers.csv`: Customer data.  
- `products.csv`: Product data.  
- `transactions.csv`: Transaction data.  

### 3. SQL Queries  
A series of SQL queries are included to analyze the data, such as:  
- **Top 5 products by revenue.**  
- **Monthly revenue trends.**  
- **Most active customers.**
